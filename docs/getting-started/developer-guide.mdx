## Mono-repo

This project is setup as a [mono-repo](https://danluu.com/monorepo/) and leverages [lerna](https://lernajs.io) to manage the multiple NPM packages. All packages are configured to be versioned together; meaning regardless of whether an individual package has changed, they all will be published with the same version. Package directories are defined in both `./lerna.json` and in the root `package.json`:

```js
// lerna.json
{
  "packages": [...]
}

// root package.json
{
  "workspaces": [...]
}
```

## Packages Overview

All packages contain their own `package.json` that defines their dependencies. Only non-dev dependencies are in a package's `package.json`, while dev dependencies is located in the root `package.json` (see [managing dependecies](#managing-dependencies) for more information).

### Component Package

Located in `./packages/components`, this package is the relevant package and will contain vast majority of your development work. It contains all components that will be used by consumers; VersionOne and Continuum.

### Build Packages

Located in the `./build` directory, these packages are not compiled via babel and therefore they are [commonjs modules](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/modules.html). These are used for the build of other packages/the [docs site](#documentation-site).

## Managing Dependencies

This project uses yarn and [lerna](https://lernajs.io) to manage NPM package dependencies.

> **remember**: this is a mono-repo and there are multiple packages in this repo; therefore you will need to specify which package the new dependency will be installed

- use `yarn lerna add --scope @versionone/components dependency-pkg-name` to install dependencies into the components package
- use `yarn add -W --dev dependency-pkg-name` to install a dev dependency

### Additional Details on Yarn and Lerna

Which package to install a new NPM package into is specified with the `--scope` CLI parameter. Most of the time, this scope will be `@versionone/components`, but in the case that a new NPM package is required for another package in the repo, we can specify the `--scope` to something else. Examples below:

- use `yarn lerna add --scope @versionone/pkg-name dependency-pkg-name` to install dependencies into a specific package
- also applies to internal packages; `yarn lerna add --scope @versionone/pkg-name @versionone/other-pkg-name`

## Developer Tasks

- `yarn start` - locally run docs site: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `yarn test:e2e` - run sub-set of cypress tests for development/debugging purposes
- `yarn test:e2e:cli` - run all e2e tests from CLI
- `yarn lint` - lint source files
- `yarn verify` - run both tests and linting concurrently (quickly verify changes before issuing PR)

## Debugging Tests Locally

[Cypress](http://cypress.io) is used for our end-to-end tests. All Cypress tests live in the `./cypress/integration` directory.

1. Server must be running locally via `yarn start`
2. In a separate console; `yarn cypress open` will open the cypress window
3. Selectively run test files from cypress window

## Documentation site

The docs site is built with [docz](https://www.docz.site/) and its configuration may be found in `./doczrc.js`.
