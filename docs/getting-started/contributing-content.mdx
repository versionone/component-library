- pages are [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) files with the `.mdx` extension ([read more about MDX](https://mdxjs.com/))
- non-techncial guides should live in `./docs` directory
- component or package documentation should be a `README.mdx` file in each component/package directory
- see [Getting Started](/#prerequisite-software) for IDE extenions providing MDX support

> directory structure has **no impact** on the menu groupings

## Anatomy of an MDX File

### Frontmatter

Every `.mdx` file contains **YAML frontmatter** at the **top of the file**. This contains metadata about the documentation page. The frontmatter specifies the page's name (**menu item text**) and **menu grouping**.

```markdown
---
name: My New Page
menu: About
---
```

### Using React Components

Components, and other JavaScript modules, can be imported into an `.mdx` file. All import statements should appear as a block immediately after the frontmatter; containing an empty newline before and after the block.

```markdown
---
name: TextField
menu: Data Entry
---

import { Playground, PropsTable } from '@versionone/doc-components';
import { TextField } from './src';

<Playground>
  <TextField />
</Playground>
```

## Images

Image files must be sourced relative to the `.mdx` and can be included via standard markdown, as shown below:

```markdown
![alt text](./path/to/image.png)
```
