## Types of Versions

[Semver](https://semver.org/) versioning is used. As an overview:

- A **major** version is when a incompatible API change is made.
- A **minor** version is when a functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner.
- A **patch** version is when a backward-compatible bug fix is made.

Version numbers should follow the pattern MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

## Branching Strategy

There is 1 main branch `master` where changes should be published from.

> Pull Request process:
>
> - Open Pull Request in Github
> - Have 2 people (a member each from Core and Continuum) review and approve the changes
> - Use Github to merge Pull Request

Note that upon merging to master, the docs site will be not be available until the build finishes.

## How to Publish

The library publishes to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@versionone/components). Login is required, either with the VersionOne account or with an existing account that is linked to our org.

> Be sure to Login using `npm login` before attempting to publish.

### Publishing Major, Minor, and Patch Versions

Feature branches should be merged into `master` before publishing from `master`. Upon merging to `master`, create a production build and publish with the following:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production yarn build
yarn lerna publish {major|minor|patch}
```

> If you forget to Login using `npm login` before the above, you can publish directly from the current commit.

```bash
yarn lerna publish from-git
```

### Canary Releases

Occassionaly there may be changes that we want sooner than waiting for a new version publish. These "canary" releases ([read more](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/publish#--canary)) may be made for any given version and provide a way to release experimental features to consumers before an official publish. An example of publishing a canary release:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production yarn build
yarn lerna publish --canary {preminor|prepatch}
# or for a major version
yarn lerna publish --canary premajor
```

## Publishing the Site

> This step is currently set to Deploy Automatically

A deployment preview of the docs site gets published on every Pull Request as well as every merge to master and next.

> You can find a link to the build site in the Pull Request details (upon successfully passing all tests)

In addition, the docs site is updated automatically every time a Pull Request is merged to master. Note that the site will be unavailable while master is building.

If you want to publish a new release of the site manually, instead of a preview deployment, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Log into [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
2. Navigate to the `versionone-components` project
3. On project overview, scroll to "Production Deploys" and click on the desired production build.
4. Click the "Publish Deploy" button in the first box

## Trouble Shooting Common Issues

### Unsucessful Publish to NPM

> If you forget to Login using `npm login` before the above, you can publish directly from the current commit.

```bash
yarn lerna publish from-git
```

### Remove git tag

git tag -d v0.0.1

git push origin :refs/tags/v0.0.1

### Revert a Publsh to the NPM Registry

This can only be done within 72 hours. See [this article](https://docs.npmjs.com/unpublishing-packages-from-the-registry) for more details.

### Netlify site is down

While publishing the site, the current netlify site (https://versionone-components.netlify.com) will be down for approximately 30 minutes.
