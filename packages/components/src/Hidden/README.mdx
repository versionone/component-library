# Hidden

Either visually hide content from the screen, but keep it accessible for screen readers or hide content from screen readers, but show it visually.

## Visually Hiding Content

A common example of when to visually hide content is the `IconButton`'s title text. The meaning of an `IconButton` is not displayed on the screen, but provides easier navigation by screen readers than simply the `Icon`.

<Playground>
  View the hidden content in the developer tools.
  <VisuallyHidden>
    I am hidden from view, but not from screen readers
  </VisuallyHidden>
</Playground>

## Hiding from Screen readers

A common example of when to hide content from screen readers are `Icon`s within `IconButton`s.

<Playground>
  <HiddenFromScreenReaders>
    I am hidden from screen readers, but not from the screen.
  </HiddenFromScreenReaders>
</Playground>
