The physical properties of paper are translated to the screen.
Great for creating depth to the application with the use of shadows.

<Playground>
  <SpacedGroup direction="vertical" xs={16}>
    <Paper>
      <SpacedGroup xs={24}>
        <span>Content</span>
      </SpacedGroup>
    </Paper>
    <Paper square>square paper</Paper>
