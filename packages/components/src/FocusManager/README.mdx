# FocusManager

Provides a way to group focusable items and navigate between these groups. This is useful for components that "take the focus" to a new location and then "give it back" once complete. See [Drawer](/components/Drawer#focus) for a real-world example.

<SpacedGroup>
  <Lozenge bold variant="warning" text="Experimental" />
</SpacedGroup>

## Defining a Focus Group

A `FocusGroup` is a group of focusable items. It provides the proper event handlers to update focus (onFocus/onBlur), as well as a way to return focus to the previous focus group.

> Remember to use the `FocusManager` as a parent somewhere in the UI tree.

<Playground>
  <FocusManager>
    {pop => (
      <FocusManager.Group>
        {bind => (
          <Fragment>
            Not In Focus Group
            <TextField {...bind} />
            <FocusManager.Group>
              {bind => (
                <Border>
                  In Focus Group
                  <SpacedGroup>
                    <TextField {...bind} />
                    <TextField {...bind} />
                    <TextField {...bind} />
                    <Button onClick={pop}>Go Back Previous Focus Group</Button>
                  </SpacedGroup>
                </Border>
              )}
            </FocusManager.Group>
          </Fragment>
        )}
      </FocusManager.Group>
    )}
  </FocusManager>
</Playground>
