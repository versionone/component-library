Expander is used to hide information from the user that is optional or secondary in a way that it can be retrieved by expanding the section it is contianed within.

<Playground>
  <SpacedGroup direction="vertical" xs={24}>
    <Expander title="Show Details">
      This content can be hidden from the user in order to reduce the mental
      overhead required to understand the form or content.
    </Expander>
    <Expander expandedTitle="Hide Details" expanded>
      This content can be hidden from the user in order to reduce the mental
      overhead required to understand the form or content.
    </Expander>
    <Expander title="Custom Show Details">
      This content can be hidden from the user in order to reduce the mental
      overhead required to understand the form or content.
    </Expander>
    <Expander expandedTitle="Custom Hide Details" expanded>
      This content can be hidden from the user in order to reduce the mental
      overhead required to understand the form or content.

  {() => {
    class StateManager extends React.Component {
      constructor(props, context) {
        super(props, context);
        this.state = { isExpanded: false };
        this.toggleExpanded = this.toggleExpanded.bind(this);
      }
      toggleExpanded() {
        this.setState({ isExpanded: !this.state.isExpanded });
      }
      render() {
        return (

            title="Show Details"
            expandedTitle="Hide Details"
            expanded={this.state.isExpanded}
