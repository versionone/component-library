# Expander

Expander is used to hide information from the user that is optional or secondary in a way that it can be retrieved by expanding the section it is contianed within.

<Playground>
	<SpacedGroup direction="vertical" xs={24}>
		<Expander title="Show Details">
			This content can be hidden from the user in order to reduce the mental overhead required to understand the form or content.
		</Expander>
		<Expander expandedTitle="Hide Details" expanded>
			This content can be hidden from the user in order to reduce the mental overhead required to understand the form or content.
		</Expander>

    	<Expander title="Custom Show Details">
    		This content can be hidden from the user in order to reduce the mental overhead required to understand the form or content.
    	</Expander>
    	<Expander expandedTitle="Custom Hide Details" expanded>
    		This content can be hidden from the user in order to reduce the mental overhead required to understand the form or content.
    	</Expander>
    </SpacedGroup>

</Playground>

## Stateful

<Playground>
	{() => {
		class StateManager extends React.Component {
			constructor(props, context) {
				super(props, context);
				this.state = { isExpanded: false };
				this.toggleExpanded = this.toggleExpanded.bind(this);
			}

    		toggleExpanded() {
    			this.setState({ isExpanded: !this.state.isExpanded });
    		}

    		render() {
    			return (
    				<Expander
    					title="Show Details"
    					expandedTitle="Hide Details"
    					expanded={this.state.isExpanded}
    					onToggle={this.toggleExpanded}
    				>
    					This content can be hidden from the user in order to reduce the mental overhead required to understand the form or content.
    				</Expander>
    			)
    		}
    	}

    	return <StateManager />
    }}
